# Barbearia Alura

This is a web page developed during a four-part HTML CSS course from Alura during the Cloud Girls Project in 2023. In the first stage, we created the home page where we designed the entire visual presentation of Barbearia Alura. We learned how to work with text, images, how to markup text, and how to transform all the HTML content into visually appealing presentation.

In the second module, we advanced to the product page, where we learned how to create lists, work with responsive elements, as well as display line and display block, and how HTML and its spacing behave.

In the third module, we moved on to the contact page, where we delved deep into how a form and table work on the internet. We went through all the types of fields, how to create good usability, add required fields, and what the difference is between a text field, email, and phone.

In the last module, we focused on the home page, which was visually unfinished and incompatible with the other pages. We modified the font, improved the content distribution, added shadow effects, imported a map, and a video to the site.
